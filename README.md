<h2>Hardware Components</h2>

<h3>STM32MP135F-DK</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Main Controller</strong>: This board is responsible for deploying the primary application and providing a GUI for user interaction. It controls the botâ€™s features, modes, robotic arm configuration, and visualizes sensor data for real-time monitoring and control.</li>
</ul>

<h3>X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2 MEMS Sensor Expansion Board</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Navigation Support</strong>: This board handles the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for bot navigation. Sensor fusion techniques have been integrated for it to work with  perimeter wire-based navigation, ensuring accurate and safe movement across the field.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation and Setup</h2>
<h2>Deploying the Application on STM32MP135F-DK</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare and Connect the STM32MP1 Target</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Insert an SD card into the STM32MP135F-DK board.</li>
  <li>Connect your PC to the ST-LINK/V2-1 port (CN10, Micro-USB) on the STM32MP135F-DK.</li>
  <li>Connect a power supply to the PWR IN port (USB Type-C) or use your PC to power the board.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 2: Download the Linux Image to the STM32MP1</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Download the <strong>STM32MP13x OpenSTLinux Starter Package</strong> from STMicroelectronics.</li>
  <li>Install the STM32MP1 SDK to work with Embedded Wizard. Follow the setup instructions provided <a href="https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/wiki/Getting_started/STM32MP1_boards/STM32MP135x-DK/Develop_on_Arm%C2%AE_Cortex%C2%AE-A7">here</a> to configure the SDK and toolchain for STM32MP1.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 4: Deploy the Application</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to the <strong>STM32MP135FDK</strong> folder where the <code>.bin</code> file is located and copy it to the STM32MP135F-DK.</li>
  <li>SSH into the STM32MP135F-DK or use a terminal to access the board.</li>
  <li>Stop the Wayland/Weston service before running the application by executing one of the following commands:
    <pre><code>systemctl stop weston-launch.service</code></pre>
    Or:
    <pre><code>pkill weston</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Navigate to the folder where you copied the application file on the STM32MP135F-DK.</li>
  <li>Run the application by executing:
    <pre><code>./KrishiApp</code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>
